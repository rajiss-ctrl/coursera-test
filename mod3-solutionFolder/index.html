     <p> Welcome!
      I wrote this book to help you quickly learn HTML and get familiar with
the advanced HTML topics.
HTML, a shorthand for Hyper Text Markup Language, is one of the
most fundamental building blocks of the Web.
HTML was officially born in 1993 and since then it evolved into its
current state, moving from simple text documents to powering rich
Web Applications.
This handbook is aimed at a vast audience.
First, the beginner. I explain HTML from zero in a succinct but
comprehensive way, so you can use this book to learn HTML from the
basics.
Then, the professional. HTML is often considered like a secondary
thing to learn. It might be given for granted.
Yet lots of things are obscure to many people. Me included. I wrote
this handbook to help my understanding of the topic, because when I
need to explain something, I better make sure I first know the thing
inside out.
Introduction

Even if you don't write HTML in your day to day work, knowing how
HTML works can help save you some headaches when you need to
understand it from time to time, for example while tweaking a web
page.

Preface
Preface
HTML is the foundation of the marvel called the Web.
There is an incredible power underneath this rather simple and limited
set of rules, which lets us -- developers, makers, designers, writers,
and tinkerers -- craft documents, apps, and experiences for people all
around the globe.
My first HTML book came out in 1997 and was called "HTML
Unleashed". A big, lots-of-pages, long tome.
20+ years have passed, and HTML is still the foundation of the Web,
with minimal changes from back then.
Sure, we got more semantic tags, presentational HTML is no longer a
thing, and CSS has taken care of the design of things.
HTML's success is based on one thing: simplicity.
It resisted being hijacked into an XML dialect via XHTML, when
eventually people realized that thing was way, way too complex.
It did so because of another feature it provides us: forgiveness. There
are some rules, right, but after you learn those, you have a lot of
freedom.
Browsers learned to be resilient and to always try to do their best when
parsing and presenting HTML to the users.

And the whole Web platform did one thing right: it never broke
backward compatibility. Pretty incredibly, we can go back to HTML
documents written in 1991, and they look pretty much as they looked
back then.
We even know what the first web page was. It's this:
http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
And you can see the source of the page, thanks to another big feature
of the Web and HTML: we can inspect the HTML of any web page.
Don't take this for granted. I don't know any other platform that gives
us this ability.
The exceptional Developer Tools built into any browser let us inspect
and take inspiration from HTML written by anyone in the world.
If you are new to HTML this book aims to help you get started. If you
are a seasoned Web Developer this book will improve your
knowledge.
I learned so much while writing it, even though I've been working with
the Web for 20+ years, and I'm sure you'll find something new, too.
Or you'll re-learn something old you forgot.
In any case, the goal of the book is to be useful to you, and I hope it
succeeds.

HTML Basics
HTML Basics
HTML is a standard defined by the WHATWG, an acronym for Web
Hypertext Application Technology Working Group, an organization
formed by people working on the most popular web browser. This
means it's basically controlled by Google, Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft.
In the past the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) was the
organization in charge of creating the HTML standard.
The control informally moved from W3C to WHATWG when it became
clear that the W3C push towards XHTML was not a good idea.
If you've never heard of XHTML, here's a short story. In the early
2000s, we all believed the future of the Web was XML (seriously). So
HTML moved from being an SGML-based authoring language to an
XML markup language.
It was a big change. We had to know, and respect, more rules. Stricter
rules.
Eventually browser vendors realized this was not the right path for the
Web, and they pushed back, creating what is now known as HTML5.
