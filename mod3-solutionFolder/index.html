     <p> Welcome!
      I wrote this book to help you quickly learn HTML and get familiar with
the advanced HTML topics.
HTML, a shorthand for Hyper Text Markup Language, is one of the
most fundamental building blocks of the Web.
HTML was officially born in 1993 and since then it evolved into its
current state, moving from simple text documents to powering rich
Web Applications.
This handbook is aimed at a vast audience.
First, the beginner. I explain HTML from zero in a succinct but
comprehensive way, so you can use this book to learn HTML from the
basics.
Then, the professional. HTML is often considered like a secondary
thing to learn. It might be given for granted.
Yet lots of things are obscure to many people. Me included. I wrote
this handbook to help my understanding of the topic, because when I
need to explain something, I better make sure I first know the thing
inside out.
Introduction

Even if you don't write HTML in your day to day work, knowing how
HTML works can help save you some headaches when you need to
understand it from time to time, for example while tweaking a web
page.

Preface
Preface
HTML is the foundation of the marvel called the Web.
There is an incredible power underneath this rather simple and limited
set of rules, which lets us -- developers, makers, designers, writers,
and tinkerers -- craft documents, apps, and experiences for people all
around the globe.
My first HTML book came out in 1997 and was called "HTML
Unleashed". A big, lots-of-pages, long tome.
20+ years have passed, and HTML is still the foundation of the Web,
with minimal changes from back then.
Sure, we got more semantic tags, presentational HTML is no longer a
thing, and CSS has taken care of the design of things.
HTML's success is based on one thing: simplicity.
It resisted being hijacked into an XML dialect via XHTML, when
eventually people realized that thing was way, way too complex.
It did so because of another feature it provides us: forgiveness. There
are some rules, right, but after you learn those, you have a lot of
freedom.
Browsers learned to be resilient and to always try to do their best when
parsing and presenting HTML to the users.

And the whole Web platform did one thing right: it never broke
backward compatibility. Pretty incredibly, we can go back to HTML
documents written in 1991, and they look pretty much as they looked
back then.
We even know what the first web page was. It's this:
</p>
    </div>
  </div> <!-- row div end -->
  </div>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">
    <div class=" col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 write-up">
      <h2>Beef</h2>
